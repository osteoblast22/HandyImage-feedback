## What is this userscript for ?

This userscript is used to simplify reporting broken sites to [HandyImage's](https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage/) issue page

### How to set it up

First you need a github access token, head over to [github tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create an access token, name it anything you want,give it only one scope "public_repo"
Then install the userscript as usual, from the tampermonkey menu choose "Handy Image feedback: github settings" here you enter your github username and access token

### How to use it

While you browse the internet if you come across an image hosting site that seems not supported by ImageHandy just open the tampermonkey menu and click "Handy Image feedback: Submit this site"
this will report the site to the issues page of HandyImage, the url of the page you're in will be sent as a sample image for Owyn to work on, so make sure your on the right page when you click the button
